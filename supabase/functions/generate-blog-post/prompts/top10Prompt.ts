PRODUCT DATA:
I've provided you with detailed information about ${amazonProducts.length} products. Use this data to create a rich, detailed blog post. For each product, I've included:

1. Basic information (title, brand, ASIN, price, rating, etc.)
2. Specifications and features
3. Reviews and user feedback
4. Raw data with additional details about features, specifications, and more

USE THE RAW DATA: Each product has a 'rawData' field containing additional information that isn't presented in the basic fields. Make use of this detailed information to create more specific, accurate descriptions of each product.

Here's the product data to reference:
`;

    // Add formatted product data in a readable way
    amazonProducts.forEach((product, index) => {
      top10SystemPrompt += `
PRODUCT ${index + 1}: ${product.title}
- Brand: ${product.brand || 'Unknown'}
- Price: $${product.price?.toFixed(2) || 'N/A'}
- Rating: ${product.rating || 'N/A'}/5 (${product.ratingCount || 0} reviews)
- ASIN: ${product.asin || 'N/A'}

SPECIFICATIONS:
${product.specs || 'No specifications provided'}

        // Features
        if (product.rawData.features && product.rawData.features.length > 0) {
          top10SystemPrompt += `FEATURES:\n`;

            top10SystemPrompt += `- ${feature}\n`;

        if (product.rawData.reviews && product.rawData.reviews.length > 0) {

          product.rawData.reviews.forEach((review: any, idx: number) => {
            if (idx < 2 && review.text) { // Limit to 2 reviews to save space
              top10SystemPrompt += `- ${review.text.substring(0, 200)}${review.text.length > 200 ? '...' : ''}\n`;

          });
          top10SystemPrompt += `\n`;
        }
        
        // Description excerpt
        if (product.rawData.description) {
