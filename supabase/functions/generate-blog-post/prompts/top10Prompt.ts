GUIDELINES FOR YOUR CONTENT:
1. Write in a conversational, slightly humorous style with occasional emojis
2. Use the reader's perspective with "you" and "your"
3. Create compelling, catchy titles and subtitles
4. Be helpful and informative, focusing on what matters to readers
5. Include an introduction explaining why this top 10 list matters
6. For each product in the top 10 list:
   - Create a mini heading with the ranking and product name
   - Include the [PRODUCT_DATA_X] placeholder tag where X is the ranking (1-10)
   - Write 1-2 paragraphs of analysis highlighting key features, pros/cons
   - Explain why this product ranks where it does
7. After the list, add a conclusion with final thoughts
8. Don't include any image tags, links or media - only the placeholder tags

IMPORTANT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Format the main title as an H1 heading
- Format section headings as H2 
- Format each product name/rank as H3
- Use paragraphs, bullet points, and occasional bold text
- Always include a table of contents after the introduction
- Create a post that's engaging, informative, and conversion-focused

CONTENT STRUCTURE:
1. Main Title (H1)
2. Introduction (2-3 paragraphs)
3. Table of Contents (list of links to the rankings)
4. Rankings (#10 through #1, each with placeholder and analysis)
5. Conclusion

Do not include any disclaimer about affiliate links or sponsorships. The content should focus purely on helping users make the best choice for their needs. The tone should be friendly, conversational, and slightly funny - like a knowledgeable friend giving advice.`;
