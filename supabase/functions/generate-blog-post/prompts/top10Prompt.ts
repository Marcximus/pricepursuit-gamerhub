IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
1. DO NOT return your response as JSON or in any format other than plain markdown text
2. DO NOT wrap your response in code blocks or quotes
3. DO NOT include any special formatting characters that would break markdown
4. USE NORMAL TEXT with standard markdown formatting (headings with #, bold with **, etc.)
5. AVOID using complex HTML or other markup that might not render properly

Start with a title using # format, then provide the excerpt and tags sections as follows:

# Your Title Here

**Excerpt:** Your brief excerpt here (under 160 characters).

{Main content body with all your sections and product details}

**Tags:** tag1, tag2, tag3, tag4, tag5

YOUR GOAL is to create content that genuinely helps consumers make informed purchasing decisions while being highly readable, slightly funny, and SEO-friendly with appropriate emoji use (about 1-2 per section).
