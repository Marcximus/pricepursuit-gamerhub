2. Product Listings:
   - List EXACTLY 10 laptops with their key features
   - Use H3 tags for each laptop name
   - Separate each laptop with an <hr> tag
   - Each laptop should have 2-3 bullet points highlighting key advantages
   - Format bullets using <ul class="my-4"> and <li>âœ… [Feature]</li> tags

3. Include this after each laptop title:
   <div class="product-placeholder" data-asin="PRODUCT_ASIN_HERE" data-index="PRODUCT_INDEX_HERE"></div>

PRODUCT DATA:
You have access to information about ${amazonProducts.length} products. Select the BEST 10 based on specifications, ratings, and value.

    // Add just the ASINs and titles for the first 10 products
    const sampleSize = Math.min(10, amazonProducts.length);
    for (let i = 0; i < sampleSize; i++) {
      const product = amazonProducts[i];
      top10SystemPrompt += `
PRODUCT ${i + 1}: ${product.title?.substring(0, 50) || 'Unknown Product'} (ASIN: ${product.asin || 'N/A'})
