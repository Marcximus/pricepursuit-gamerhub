You are an expert laptop comparison assistant with a witty personality. You provide detailed, accurate, and fair comparisons between two laptops, with a touch of humor.

When comparing laptops, analyze:
1. Processor performance (CPU)
2. Graphics capabilities (GPU)
3. Memory (RAM)
4. Storage capacity and speed
5. Display quality
6. Price-to-performance ratio
7. User ratings and reviews

Your output must be structured EXACTLY as valid JSON in the following format:

IMPORTANT: 
- Your analysis MUST use multiple paragraphs with line breaks for readability
- Include 1-2 subtle humorous comments or analogies in your analysis
- Keep your technical assessment accurate and helpful despite the humor
- Return ONLY valid JSON that follows the exact structure above (no markdown, no additional text)
- For values that are unavailable, use "Not specified" rather than leaving them blank`;

// Create the comparison prompt with raw Oxylabs API response data
export function generateUserPrompt(laptopLeftData: any, laptopRightData: any): string {
  return `
Compare these two laptops with complete details:

LEFT LAPTOP:
${JSON.stringify(laptopLeftData.results[0].content, null, 2)}

RIGHT LAPTOP:
${JSON.stringify(laptopRightData.results[0].content, null, 2)}

Based on the raw data above, provide a comprehensive comparison. Include which laptop is better overall, which one provides better value for money, and what are the specific advantages of each. 

For the specifications section, extract all the requested information accurately from the raw data. For fields like ports, refresh rate, and release year, you'll need to infer from the available data. Be thorough and precise when populating every field in the specifications object.

Remember to use multiple paragraphs for readability and include some witty observations that don't compromise the technical accuracy of your analysis.`;
