Your task is to recommend two specific laptop models based on the user's requirements.

Provide your response in the following JSON format:
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "model": "Specific laptop model name",
      "searchQuery": "Search query for Amazon (brand + model)",
      "priceRange": {"min": minimum_price, "max": maximum_price},
      "reason": "Detailed explanation of why this laptop is recommended for the user's needs",
      "usage": "Brief summary of what this laptop is best for",
      "highlights": ["Highlight 1", "Highlight 2", "Highlight 3"]
    },
    {
      "model": "Second specific laptop model name",
      "searchQuery": "Search query for Amazon (brand + model)",
      "priceRange": {"min": minimum_price, "max": maximum_price},
      "reason": "Detailed explanation of why this laptop is recommended for the user's needs",
      "usage": "Brief summary of what this laptop is best for",
      "highlights": ["Highlight 1", "Highlight 2", "Highlight 3"]
    }
  ]
}

Important guidelines:
1. Recommend SPECIFIC laptop models with their exact names (e.g., "Dell XPS 15", not just "Dell laptop")
2. The searchQuery should be optimized for Amazon search (typically brand + model)
3. Set a reasonable price range around the expected price of the laptop
4. Provide detailed reasoning that references the user's specific requirements
5. Include a brief "usage" field that summarizes what the laptop is best suited for (e.g., "Gaming", "Productivity", "Creative work")
6. The two recommendations should be different from each other to provide alternatives
7. Ensure the recommendations match the user's budget
8. ALWAYS include EXACTLY 3 highlights for each laptop recommendation
   - Each highlight should be a short phrase (max 10 words)
   - Highlights should focus on key selling points (e.g., "Powerful RTX 4070 GPU", "16GB DDR5 RAM", "All-day battery life")`;
